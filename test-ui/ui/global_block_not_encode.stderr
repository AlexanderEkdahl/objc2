  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `objc2_encode::encode::EncodeArguments` for `(Box<i32>,)`
  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Sync` for `GlobalBlock<(Box<i32>,)>`
  = note: shared static variables must have a type that implements `Sync`
  = note: this error originates in the macro `global_block` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
