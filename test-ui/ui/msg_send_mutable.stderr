error[E0382]: use of moved value: `obj`
   --> ui/msg_send_mutable.rs:13:36
    |
9   |     let obj: &mut Object = unsafe { msg_send![cls, new] };
    |         --- move occurs because `obj` has type `&mut objc2::runtime::Object`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
10  |
11  |     let _: () = unsafe { msg_send![obj, selector] };
    |                          ------------------------ `obj` moved due to this method call
12  |     // Could be solved with a reborrow
13  |     let _: () = unsafe { msg_send![obj, selector] };
    |                                    ^^^ value used here after move
    |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `obj`
