error[E0382]: use of moved value: `obj`
 --> ui/msg_send_mutable.rs
  |
  |     let obj: &mut Object = unsafe { msg_send![cls, new] };
  |         --- move occurs because `obj` has type `&mut objc2::runtime::Object`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
  |
  |     let _: () = unsafe { msg_send![obj, selector] };
  |                          ------------------------ `obj` moved due to this method call
  |     // Could be solved with a reborrow
  |     let _: () = unsafe { msg_send![obj, selector] };
  |                                    ^^^ value used here after move
  |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `obj`
