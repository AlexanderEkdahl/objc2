  = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!

  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__ns_string_inner` which comes from the expansion of the macro `ns_string` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
