# DISCLAIMER! These crates are work in progress, and should not be used in production environments. Use the battle-tested `objc` family instead!

Anyway, thanks for being here, any help testing things out is highly
appreciated!


## Migrating from original crates

It is recommended that you upgrade in small steps, to decrease the chance of
making a mistake somewhere. This way, you can under each release review the
relevant changelogs and run your test suite, to ensure you haven't missed
something.

As an example, if you want to migrate to `objc2`, you'd start by using it
instead of `objc` in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
objc = { package = "objc2", version = "0.2.7" }
```

Afterwards, you can upgrade to the next release, in this case
`v0.3.0-alpha.0`, and make the required changes to your code (the
[changelog](objc/CHANGELOG.m) contains recommendations for this). And so on,
with every following release.


## Goals

- **Complete Soundness.**

  The overarching goal of these crates is to be completely sound, meaning it
  must not be possible for safe Rust to cause undefined behaviour using this
  library.
  This is a really difficult task, because, as a language interface, basically
  everything it does requires `unsafe`.

  Soundness is attempted by trying to document all instances of `unsafe`, and
  the reasoning behind their safety.

  Additionally, all `unsafe` APIs contain thorough `# Safety` sections, to let
  users know exactly which safety guarantees they need to uphold.

  If you find, or think you've found, a soundness hole, please report it on
  the [issue tracker](https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/issues/new).

- **Idiomatic Rust.**

  Soundness is easy to achieve if you just mark every API as `unsafe`.
  However, that won't help us very much when we actually want to use it!

  As such, these crates also try to be as safe and idiomatic as possible;
  using references instead of pointers to represent objects and their
  mutability, `Option` instead of `null`, zero cost (always a balancing act
  against being ergonomic),

- **Portability.**

  Apple targets always have the highest priority, but there exist other
  runtimes for Objective-C, and we would like to support them without the user
  having to worry about portability issues.

  The supported runtimes are tested in CI.

- **High quality documentation.**

  This is still quite lacking, help appreciated!

## Acknowledgements

This repository is originally a fork of [`objc`], with the following
projects merged into it (see reasoning for the fork [here][origin-issue-101]):
- [`objc-encode`](https://github.com/SSheldon/rust-objc-encode)
- [`objc_exception`](https://github.com/SSheldon/rust-objc-exception)
- [`objc_id`](https://github.com/SSheldon/rust-objc-id)

- [`block`](https://github.com/SSheldon/rust-block)

These were created almost solely by [@SSheldon](https://github.com/SSheldon),
so a huge thanks for their fantastic work on these crates!

This project also draws heavy inspiration from [`fruity`] and [`objrs`].
