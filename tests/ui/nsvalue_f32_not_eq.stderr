error[E0277]: the trait bound `f32: std::cmp::Eq` is not satisfied

   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the trait `std::cmp::Eq` is not implemented for `f32`
   |
   = help: the following other types implement trait `std::cmp::Eq`:
             i128
             i16
             i32
             i64
             i8
             isize
             u128
             u16
           and 4 others
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::cmp::Eq` for `NSValue<f32>`
note: required by a bound in `needs_eq`
