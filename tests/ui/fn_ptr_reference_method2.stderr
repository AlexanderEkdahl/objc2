   = note: `MethodImplementation` would have to be implemented for the type `for<'r, 's> extern "C" fn(&'r objc2::runtime::Object, objc2::runtime::Sel, &'s objc2::runtime::Object)`
   = note: ...but `MethodImplementation` is actually implemented for the type `for<'r> extern "C" fn(&'r objc2::runtime::Object, objc2::runtime::Sel, &'0 objc2::runtime::Object)`, for some specific lifetime `'0`
