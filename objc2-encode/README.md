Objective-C type-encoding in Rust.

The Objective-C directive `@encode` encodes types as strings for usage in
various places in the runtime.

This crate provides the `Encoding` type to describe and compare these
type-encodings without memory allocation.

Additionally it provides traits for annotating types that has a corresponding
Objective-C encoding, respectively `Encode` for structs and `RefEncode` for
references (and `EncodeArguments` for function arguments).

These types are exported under the `objc2` crate as well, so usually you would
just use that.


## Examples

Implementing `Encode` and `RefEncode`:

```rust
use objc2_encode::{Encode, Encoding, RefEncode};

#[repr(C)]
struct MyObject {
    a: f32,
    b: i16,
}

unsafe impl Encode for MyObject {
    const ENCODING: Encoding<'static> = Encoding::Struct(
        "MyObject",
        &[f32::ENCODING, i16::ENCODING],
    );
}

assert!(MyObject::ENCODING.equivalent_to_str("{MyObject=fs}"));

unsafe impl RefEncode for MyObject {
    const ENCODING_REF: Encoding<'static> = Encoding::Pointer(&Self::ENCODING);
}

assert!(MyObject::ENCODING_REF.equivalent_to_str("^{MyObject=fs}"));
```

An `Encoding` can be compared with an encoding string from the Objective-C
runtime:

```rust
use objc2_encode::Encode;
assert!(i32::ENCODING.equivalent_to_str("i"));
```

`Encoding` implements `Display` as its string representation. This can be
generated conveniently through the `to_string` method:

```rust
use objc2_encode::Encode;
assert_eq!(i32::ENCODING.to_string(), "i");
```
